# Snake-Game

Welcome to the Snake Game repository! This project implements the classic Snake Game using Java Swing and AWT libraries for the graphical user interface (GUI).

About the Project :

The Snake Game is a simple and fun arcade game where the player controls a snake that grows in length by eating food. The objective is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake’s own body while attempting to achieve the highest score possible.
This implementation utilizes Swing and AWT for the graphical representation of the game, providing a retro-style gaming experience.

Technologies Used :

Java (Programming Language)
Swing (GUI Components)
AWT (Graphics Rendering)

How to Play:

Use the arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →) to control the snake's direction.
Objective: Guide the snake to eat the food that appears on the screen.
Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself.
